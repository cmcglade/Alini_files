<h1>
	Hello, my name is Aline
</h1>

<p>
	I just turned 29 years old, just moved to Toronto, in Canada, and just started a graduate certificate in Interactive Media Mannagement, at Centennial College. I can say that I am having a fresh start this Fall 2015.
	I am brazillian, have a bachelor in Journalism, from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and a certificate in Marketing, from UCLA. I worked in two big newspapers in Brazil and in a fashion e-commerce start-up in Los Angeles, where I lived for the last two and a half years.
	
	<br>Now I am getting ready to take my career to another level and becoming a digital strategist. But my road is open. And, since my classes started, I have been getting in touch with so many new trends and concepts, that my path might change in the course of this year. 
	
	<br>For now, this is my first webpage, with content and coding written by me and I am proud of that.
